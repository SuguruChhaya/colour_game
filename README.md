# colour_game

(I got this project idea from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/color-game-python. I added a couple twists of my own.)

1. The final file is final_colour_game.py. If you download all the files and folders, an account window should pop up.
2. The highscores.db file is a sqlite databse which tracks user accounts and highscores. Please make sure to download this file as well. I have made sure that no records are inserted at first.
3. The audio folder includes all the audio I used in the "hard" level of this game.
4. The managedatabase.py file can manually add, update, show, and delete items from the databse without playing the game. 
5. The prototypes folder includes files I worked on before creating the final file.

You are more than welcome to let me know if you find any bugs or if you had made any pull requests at my email, suguruchhaya@gmail.com.

# I hope you find the game interesting!!
